### Hi there 👋

 🧑‍💻 Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a frontend developer with a passion for web design and a background in game development. Proficient in JavaScript, React, Node.js, Sequelize, and Redux, I recently graduated from a web technologies bootcamp, where I honed my skills in React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Express, and Redux.

In addition to my web development expertise, I have experience in game development using Unity and C#. My creative approach and love for design have driven me to master CSS and explore cutting-edge technologies like Three.js, which beautifully combine art and code.

I am always eager to take on new challenges and contribute to exciting projects. Let's build something amazing together! 🎮      ...
